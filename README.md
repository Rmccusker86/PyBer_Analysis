Pyber Analysis:
The purpose of this analysis was to use a dataset of ride shares from a five month period to determine the amount of rides taken and drivers available in the urban, suburban, and rural city types.

Challenge:
With the information given, The Pyber Summary Dataframe provides us with a comparison of the ridesharing services in the three types of cities: rural, suburban, and urban cities. It is made apparent that there is a much larger demand for Pyber among the urban cities in comparison to either suburban and rural. With just the data coming from January 2019-May 2019, there were a total of 1625 rides taken in urban cities, 625 rides in suburban cities, and 125 rides in rural cities.  Looking at the figure below, it highlights the much greater amount of Pyber rides in the urban cities.

With much the same pattern, there was a much more substantial amount of drivers in the urban city type in comparison to the suburban and rural. There were 2,405 drivers in urban cities, 490 drivers in suburban cities, and 78 in rural cities.

With the much higher usage of Pyber in the urban cities, the total amount of fares is much higher than those of suburban and rural cities. The transactions in urban cities totaled nearly $40,000, while only $19,000 in suburban, and $4,000 in rural cities.

As far as cost is concerned, the riders in rural cities pay almost $10 more for the Pyber rides than in urban cities. Meanwhile, the average fare in suburban cities is close to being in the middle of the other two cities at $31 per ride

By looking at the multiple-line chart created “Total Fare by City Type” further supports the findings from the Pyber Summary Dataframe. It shows the total fares in the three different city types over the five month period. With the urban cities in the yellow line, showing a total from about $1,600 at the start of the record to $2,300 at the end of the recorded data. Suburban is indicated in red with the totals ranging from $700-$1,300. While rural is displayed with the blue line, and it shows totals from $300-$500.

Summary:
By looking at these results, the most apparent observation is that the vast majority of usage, revenue, and drivers all come from the urban city type. 
With this is in mind, riders in rural cities paid much more per ride than in urban. Which could very well discourage them from using the Pyber service in the future. This most likely comes from the more spread out placement that occurs in the rural communities. One way to help even this out would maybe to slightly lower the cost per mile in the rural cities. This could very well encourage more riders to use the service, which in turn would generate more revenue.
Also, the drivers in rural cities are earning much more than those in urban. This fact could disparage new employees from wanting to work for the company. 
And lastly, with the data reflected in the suburban city types, it could be beneficial to try and increase the amount of rides taken, since it averages the amount per ride and amount given to the drivers.
